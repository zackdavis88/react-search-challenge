# React Challenge

## Notes From the Developer

1. This app uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve all data.

2. I removed sorting from the app completely for this implementation. The reason is because the PokeAPI
   does not appear to have a way to sort a list of results by name. The API does support pagination, so I added that.

3. Clicking the Pokedex logo will send you to the homepage (SearchPage)


## Tasks

1. Modify the current app to replace the profiles pulled from the static JSON file with data pulled from a live api. This should be a public api.
1. Add a new page to the site for rendering the full profile. You should use react router and both the search profile page should be responsive.
1. Utilize a styled component framework to replace inline styles.
1. The search results should refetch every 10 seconds and the user should be presented a way to disable/enable this auto-refetch. There should be a visual timer that counts down to the next refresh.

Notes â€“ we will be grading this for accuracy and error handling.
